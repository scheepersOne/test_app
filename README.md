- The main problem we have is when we use the code that syomna provided 
  for the textFormField to get user input, and there is two of the same variables
  that needs to be added to each other (example: spoiled and spoiledOld), 
  We get an error where when we save the new information, it does not add the values...
  These values needs to be added to each other and the save onpressed should update the 
  value.

- The second topic would be the list of tasks, on the notes task page; we currently see all the 
  tasks and the day the tasks need to be done.  we want to make it so that the tasks is stored in a
  list that only displays the remaining tasks for the dateTime that is today, and the remaining
  days.  The days that have passed should not be displayed in the tasks view page...
  
- every task widget should have a textFormField that allows the user to add the temperature
  for each day and be saved to that day separately.

- on the note form widget, the app currently automatically adds the date on when the house gets added.  
  we want to make it so that the user can choose whether to use today's date automatically, 
  or enter their own date.  
  We should implement a checkbox that says 'use own date' or something similar, that when checked
  displays a dateTime Picker that the user can use instead.
  If a user enters their own date the program should adapt accordingly.
